# Human Brain Connectivity
### What would I like to learn in the hands on sessions?

For me, brain data seems to be a vast amount of bits that actually contain very little interesting information about brain functioning. Being able to extract that interesting information with the means of signal processing is in my mind super _cool_.

During the HBC course, I expect that I will learn something about the __basics__ of this extraction process. Below there is a list of some questions that I have in my mind.

1. MEG and fMRI function on totally different frequency scales. When thinking about connectivity research,
  1. what are the required preprocessing steps for each kind of data set?
  1. what is actually _connectivity_ in each case?
2. Which tools can I use for connectivity research? Are they valid for other kinds of research, too?
3. In what kind of situations is connectivity research not a good idea?

With MEG data, I have already done some research using [MNE Python](https://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html). fMRI data is still somewhat mysterious for me.
